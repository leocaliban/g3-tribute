                <p>
                    <strong>Mayte Michelle Rodriguez</strong> (born July 12, 1978) is an American actress. Her breakout
                    role was as a troubled boxer in the independent film Girlfight (2000), which was met with critical
                    acclaim and earned her several awards, including the Independent Spirit Award and Gotham Award for
                    Best Debut Performance. The following year, she starred as Letty Ortiz in the blockbuster film The
                    Fast and the Furious (2001), a role she has reprised in five additional films in the Fast & Furious
                    franchise. During her career, Rodriguez has played in a number of successful action films, including
                    Resident Evil, S.W.A.T., and Avatar.

                    Rodriguez has 10 siblings and half-siblings. She was partly raised by her devoutly religious
                    maternal grandmother, and was brought up as a Jehovah's Witness (her mother's religion), although
                    she has since abandoned the faith.
