                <p>
                    In 1991, Scabbia began singing professionally as a touring musician for other bands and providing
                    backing vocals. Later that year, she met the male vocalist Andrea Ferro and bass player Marco Coti
                    Zelati of Lacuna Coil in Milan's Midnight club. At the time, the band was named Ethereal, and
                    Scabbia was first employed only as a session singer. She was employed to record backup vocals for
                    the choruses of songs on their demo tape, but the band members liked the way the male and female
                    vocals sounded together, and asked her to be a permanent member.

                    Once signed, the band changed their name to Lacuna Coil after learning that a Greek band signed to
                    Century Media had already claimed the name Ethereal. Adding new band members, Lacuna Coil began ,
                    releasing their first album in 1997.
